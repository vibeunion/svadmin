Streamdown-Svelte is a **streaming-optimized** Markdown renderer for Svelte. It was designed for AI chat interfaces where content arrives token-by-token, but it works just as well for static content.

Most Markdown renderers re-parse the entire document on every update. Streamdown-Svelte takes a different approach — it splits content into discrete blocks and only re-renders the block that changed. This means your UI stays fast, even when the response is hundreds of lines long.

## Getting started

Install the package from npm, then drop it into your component tree. Pass markdown through the \`content\` prop and Streamdown-Svelte handles the rest.

\`\`\`svelte
import { Streamdown } from "streamdown-svelte";

<Streamdown content={content} animated caret="block" />
\`\`\`

The \`animated\` prop enables a smooth fade-in on new blocks, and \`caret\` renders a blinking cursor at the end of the stream — just like the one you're watching right now.

## Plugin ecosystem

Streamdown-Svelte ships with optional plugins for common use cases. Each one is a separate package, so you only bundle what you need.

| Plugin | Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax highlighting | \`@streamdown-svelte/code\` | Shiki-powered code blocks |
| Diagrams | \`@streamdown-svelte/mermaid\` | Mermaid diagram rendering |
| Math | \`@streamdown-svelte/math\` | KaTeX math expressions |
| CJK | \`@streamdown-svelte/cjk\` | CJK line-breaking rules |

For example, the quadratic formula renders beautifully: $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Why Streamdown-Svelte?

There are plenty of Markdown renderers out there, but most of them weren't built for streaming. Here's what makes Streamdown-Svelte different:

- [x] Block-level diffing for *incremental* re-renders
- [x] First-class support for ~~incomplete~~ partial Markdown
- [x] Configurable caret styles and animations
- [ ] World domination
